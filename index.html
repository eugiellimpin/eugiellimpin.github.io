  <p>
    Yo! I'm Eugie. I'm a web developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Currently, I work for Codeflux Inc. as a software engineer building an ERP
    and other web projects. I do backend and frontend web developement and I'm
    always excited to learn new things and take on challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently, I started building LocalHunt to learn how to build things using
    Ruby and Ruby on Rails. It's not much but I think people will find it useful.

  <p>
    I'm currently looking for a new company I can call my third home. Here's my resume.
